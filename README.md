# Assignment 1 - ReactJS app.

Name: Ciaran Hickey

## Overview.

This repo contains a movie app, specifically using TMDB api and react. 
It displays the latest and greatest movies. Movie statistics, reviews and more can be found.
This assignemnt is a continuation from the weekly labs where other features must be added to the app.

### Features.
[ A bullet-point list of the __new features__ you added to the Movies Fan app (and any modifications to existing features) .]
Here
 
+ Feature 1: Three new static endpoints
  I added three new static endpoints to the app. Namely now playing, popular and top rated movies. The site header was updated to surf between the movie lists.
+ Feature 2
+ Feature 3
+ etc
+ etc

## Setup requirements.

[ Outline any non-standard setup steps necessary to run your app locally after cloning the repo.]
After cloning the repo I needed to install the node packages. I didn't clone these files as they are too large.
I could then run npm start in the movies folder and the app would run as expected. 

## API endpoints.

[ List the __additional__ TMDB endpoints used, giving the description and pathname for each one.] 



e.g.
+ Discover list of movies - discover/movie
+ Movie details - movie/:id
+ Movie genres = /genre/movie/list

## Routing.

[ List the __new routes__ supported by your app and state the associated page.]

+ /blogs - displays all published blogs.
+ /blogs/:id - displays a particular blog.
+ /blogs/:id/comments - detail view of a particular blog and its comments.
+ etc.

[If relevant, state what aspects of your app are protected (i.e. require authentication) and what is public.]

## Independent learning (If relevant).

Itemize the technologies/techniques you researched independently and adopted in your project, 
i.e. aspects not covered in the lectures/labs. Include the source code filenames that illustrate these 
(we do not require code excerpts) and provide references to the online resources that helped you (articles/blogs).
